⚙️ Key Features

Text processing with LSTM layers

Image feature extraction using CNN

Fusion of text and visual embeddings

Evaluation on IMDB sentiment labels

🧠 Tools & Libraries

Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

📊 Results

Multimodal fusion improved accuracy over single-modality models

Demonstrated effective integration of heterogeneous data

💡 Insight

Illustrates how combining visual and textual features enhances model understanding in media analytics.
